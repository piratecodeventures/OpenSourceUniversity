## Chapter 2: Python for Data Science – Data Structures

In the previous chapter, we covered the fundamentals of Python programming—from setting up your environment to writing your first lines of code using variables, operators, and control flow. With that foundation in place, it’s time to explore one of the most essential components of Python programming: **data structures**.

Data structures are at the heart of working with data in Python. Whether you're performing data analysis, cleaning datasets, or developing algorithms, understanding how to store, access, and manipulate data efficiently is crucial. Python offers a rich set of built-in data structures—such as lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and strings—that make handling complex data tasks both intuitive and powerful.

In this chapter, we’ll take a deep dive into these fundamental structures. Each section will introduce a specific type of data structure, explain its characteristics, walk through common operations, and showcase real-world examples relevant to data science.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to:

- Store and manipulate collections of data using **lists** and **tuples**
    
- Use **sets** to manage unique elements and perform set-based operations
    
- Work with **dictionaries** to handle key-value data efficiently
    
- Handle and process **strings** for working with textual information
    

These tools will become the building blocks for more advanced data processing techniques you’ll encounter in future chapters.

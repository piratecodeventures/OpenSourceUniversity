### What Are Operators?

Operators are symbols in Python that perform operations on variables and values, like adding numbers or comparing values. They’re essential for building logic and calculations in your code.

#### Types of Operators
Python has several operator types, each with a specific purpose:
- **Arithmetic Operators**: For math, like `+` (addition) or `*` (multiplication).
- **Assignment Operators**: For setting values, like `=` (equals) or `+=` (add and assign).
- **Comparison Operators**: For comparing, like `==` (equal to) or `>` (greater than).
- **Logical Operators**: For combining conditions, like `and`, `or`, `not`.
- **Identity Operators**: To check if objects are the same, like `is`, `is not`.
- **Membership Operators**: To see if a value is in a sequence, like `in`, `not in`.
- **Bitwise Operators**: For binary operations, like `&` (AND) or `<<` (left shift).

#### How They Work
Operators execute actions based on the data types. For example, `5 + 3` adds numbers, but `"hello" + " world"` concatenates strings. Python’s dynamic typing means you need to ensure types match, or you’ll get errors, like trying to add a string and a number.

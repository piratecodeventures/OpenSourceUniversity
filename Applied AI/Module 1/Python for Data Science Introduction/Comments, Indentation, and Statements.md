Comments, Indentation, and Statements

### Comments in Python
Comments are lines the interpreter ignores, used to explain code. They start with `#`, like `# This is a comment`, and are vital for readability. For multi-line comments, use multiple `#` lines, as Python doesn’t have a built-in multi-line comment syntax like `/* */` in other languages.

### Indentation in Python
Indentation defines code blocks in Python, using 4 spaces per level (e.g., inside functions or loops). It’s essential for structure, and mixing spaces with tabs can lead to errors. Consistent indentation prevents `IndentationError`, ensuring code runs smoothly.

### Statements in Python
Statements are actions Python executes, like `x = 5` or `print("Hello")`. They end with newlines, but you can use semicolons to write multiple on one line (e.g., `x = 5; y = 10`), though this is discouraged for readability.

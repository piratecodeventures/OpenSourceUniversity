This chapter serves as your starting point in learning Python. Here, we’ll lay the groundwork by introducing you to the core concepts and syntax of the language. You’ll learn how to write your first Python programs, understand how the language handles data, and explore the basic building blocks that make up every Python application.

In this chapter, we will walk through:

- How to set up your Python environment using Anaconda and essential data science packages    
- Why Python is a top choice for data science and general-purpose programming
- The fundamental elements of Python syntax, including keywords, identifiers, and statements
- How to write clean and readable code with proper comments and indentation
- Core concepts like variables, data types, standard input/output, operators, and control flow

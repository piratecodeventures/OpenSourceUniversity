Download the Source Code

**Download Source Code:**

You have two options for downloading the code.

_Option 1: Download zip file_

File: [**FastAPI**](https://github.com/codingwithroby/fastapi-the-complete-course/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

_  
Option 2: Download using git command-line_

You also have the option to download source code using git command-line.

`git clone https://github.com/codingwithroby/fastapi-the-complete-course.git`

  

Note: Option 1 and Option 2 both reference the exact same code. You only need to choose one of the options.

  

**Important:**

- For Option 1 or Option 2, navigate to the file that have **_requirements.txt_** in it.
    

- In terminal type `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
- This will download all dependencies to your machine!

# Graduation: The End of the Beginning

## 📜 Story Mode: The Captain

> **Mission Date**: 2045.01.01
> **Location**: Starship "Vector Prime" - Bridge
> **Officer**: Captain Kael
>
> **Log**: It has been a long journey.
> We started as cadets, struggling to understand a simple scalar.
> We learned to manipulate matrices, to optimize gradients, to build brains from silicon.
> We taught machines to see (CNNs), to remember (RNNs), and to understand language (Transformers).
> We shipped our creations to the stars using Docker.
>
> But this is not the end.
> The universe of AI is expanding faster than light.
> New architectures will rise. New problems will appear.
>
> You have the tools now.
> You know the Math. You know the Code. You know the System.
> The ship is yours.
>
> **"Computer! Set course for the Unknown. Warp 9. Engage."**

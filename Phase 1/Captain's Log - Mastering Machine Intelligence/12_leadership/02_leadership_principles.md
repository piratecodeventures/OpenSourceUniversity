## 1. The Core Principles

### 1.1 Principled Pragmatism
*   **"Boring Technology"**: Choose the simplest tool that solves the problem. A SQL query is better than an LLM if it works.
*   **"Ship It"**: A perfect model on your laptop produces \$0 value. A mediocre model in production produces value relative to baseline.

### 1.2 Ethical Stewardship
*   **"Don't be Evil"**: Just because you *can* build it, doesn't mean you *should*.
*   **"Accountability"**: You are responsible for what your model does. You cannot blame the "Black Box".

### 1.3 Continuous Reinvention
*   The Half-life of ML knowledge is 2 years.
*   If you stop learning, you are obsolete.
*   **"Learn how to Learn."**

## 2. Managing AI Projects

### 2.1 The Uncertainty
Traditional Software: "Build Login Page" -> 100% Success chance.
AI: "Train model to 99% accuracy" -> Unknown probability.
*   **Management Style**: Manage **Risks**, not strictly **Timelines**. Failing fast is a success.

### 2.2 Technical Debt
*   **Data Dependencies**: The silent killer. If upstream schema changes, your model breaks.
*   **Glue Code**: The spaghetti infrastructure holding the ML together.
*   **Pay it down**: Dedicate 20% time to refactoring.

## 3. Final Words

> "The true measure of a machine's intelligence is not what it knows, but how much it helps us understand ourselves."

**End of Line.**
